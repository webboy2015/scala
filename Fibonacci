/ EXERCISE
// Write some code that prints out the first 10 values of the Fibonacci sequence.
// This is the sequence where every number is the sum of the two numbers before it.
// So, the result should be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

var num1 = 0
var num2 = 1
var count = 0

while (count < 10){ println(num1)
  var sum = num1 + num2
  num1= num2
  num2 = sum
  count = count + 1
}
