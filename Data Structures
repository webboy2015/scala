// EXERCISE
// Create a list of the numbers 1-20; your job is to print out numbers that are evenly divisible by three. (Scala's
// modula operator, like other languages, is %, which gives you the remainder after division. For example, 9 % 3 = 0
// because 9 is evenly divisible by 3.) Do this first by iterating through all the items in the list and testing each
// one as you go. Then, do it again by using a filter function on the list instead.

//val numberList = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)
// Create a list from 1 to 20 programatically
val numberList = ( 1 to 20). toList
// Creating list of numbers divisible by three without / with filter
for (num <- numberList) {if (num % 3 == 0) println(num)}
val noThreeMultiples = numberList.filter( (x: Int) => x%3 == 0)
